📘 Human Activity Recognition (HAR) – ML Classification + Flask Web App

This project builds a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using classical machine learning models and provides a Flask-based web interface for easy model prediction.

📌 Overview

Problem Type: Multi-class classification

Train Shape: 7352 × 17

Test Shape: 2947 × 17

Features: 16 numeric sensor readings

Target: Activity Label

Models Included:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

AdaBoost

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

Deployment Interface: Flask Web App

📂 Dataset

File	Description	Shape
HAR_Train_.csv	Training dataset	(7352, 17)
HAR_Test_.csv	Testing dataset	(2947, 17)

Both contain:

16 sensor signals (accelerometer + gyroscope)

1 target label: activity class

Common activities include: Walking, Standing, Sitting, Laying, Upstairs / Downstairs

🧠 ML Workflow

1. Load Data

train_df = pd.read_csv("HAR_Train_.csv")
test_df = pd.read_csv("HAR_Test_.csv")

2. Split Features & Labels

X_train = train_df.drop("Activity", axis=1)
y_train = train_df["Activity"]

X_test = test_df.drop("Activity", axis=1)
y_test = test_df["Activity"]

3. Scaling

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

4. Train 5 ML Models

Models stored using pickle or joblib.

📈 Model Evaluation

Metrics used: Accuracy, Classification Report, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) usually perform best.

🌐 Flask Web Interface

A simple Flask app is built to allow users to input sensor values and get the predicted activity.

App Features:

⭐ User-friendly HTML form
⭐ Inputs are passed to trained ML model
⭐ Model returns predicted activity
⭐ Clean UI with CSS
